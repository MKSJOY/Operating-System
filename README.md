# Operating-System

This project implements several fundamental operating system algorithms using C++. The key algorithms included are:

1> Contiguous Memory Allocation: Implements memory management by allocating memory blocks in a contiguous sequence, demonstrating basic memory allocation techniques.

2> FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) Scheduling: A CPU scheduling algorithm that processes requests in the order they arrive, emphasizing simplicity and fairness in process management.

3> Priority Scheduling Algorithm: Implements a scheduling technique where processes are executed based on priority, allowing for priority-based task management in a system.

4> Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm: A CPU scheduling algorithm that assigns time slices to each process in a cyclic order, providing a fair allocation of CPU time.

5> SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling: Implements a scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the shortest burst time, optimizing average waiting time.
